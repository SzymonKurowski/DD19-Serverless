## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 45 minutes

Synopsis: In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment before attending the hands-on lab.

>**IMPORTANT**: Most Azure resources require unique names. Throughout these steps, you will see the word "SUFFIX" as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure the resource is uniquely named.

### Task 1: Provision Service Fabric Cluster

In this task, you will provision the Service Fabric Cluster in Azure.

1.  In the Azure portal, select +Create a Resource, then type "Service Fabric" into the Search the Marketplace box. Select Service Fabric Cluster from the results.

    ![In the Azure Portal, in the left pane, Create a resource is selected. In the Marketplace pane, Everything is selected. In the Everything pane, Service Fabric is typed in the search field, and under Results, Service Fabric Cluster is circled.](media/b4-image5.png "Azure Portal")

2.  On the Service Fabric Cluster blade, select Create.

3.  On the Basics blade of the Create Service Fabric cluster screen, enter the following:

-   Cluster name: Enter **contosoeventssf-SUFFIX**, replacing SUFFIX with your alias, initials, or another value to make the name unique (indicated by a green check in the text box).

-   Operating system: Set to WindowsServer 2016-Datacenter.

-   Username: Enter **holuser**.

-   Password: Enter **Password.1!!**

-   Subscription: Select the subscription you are using for this lab.

-   Resource Group: Select Create new, and enter **hands-on-lab** for the resource group name. You can add -SUFFIX, if needed to make resource group name unique. This is the resource group you will use for all resources you create for this hands-on lab.

-   Location: Select the region to use. Select the closest region to your current location.

-   Select OK.

    ![On the Basics blade, all fields are set to the previously defined settings.](media/b4-image6.png "Basics blade")

4.  On the Cluster configuration blade, set the following:

7.  Restart the VM to complete the installation and start the local Service Fabric cluster service.

### Task 6: Setup Service Fabric certificate

When you create a new Service Fabric Cluster using the portal, a secure cluster is deployed. In order to later on be able to make use of it, a certificate setup is required.

In this task, you will download the required certificate and install it on your Lab VM.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource Group you created previously and where you created the Key vault that supports the cluster.

2.  Select the key vault from the list of resources in the resource group.

18. When the import finishes successfully, select OK.

    ![Import success.](media/b4-image43.png "Import successful")

### Task 7: Validate Service Fabric ports

Occasionally, when you create a new Service Fabric Cluster using the portal, the ports that you requested are not created. This will become evident when you try to deploy and run the Web App, because the required ports will not be accessible through the cluster.

In this task, you will validate that the ports are open and if not, fix the issue.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource Group you created previously, and where you created the cluster. If your Service Fabric cluster is still deploying, do not proceed to the next step until the deployment is completed.

2.  Select the load balancer from the list of resources in the resource group.

    ![In the Azure Portal Resource Group pane, in the list of resources, the LB-contosoeventssf-SUFFIX-Web load balancer is circled.](media/b4-image45.png "Resource group list")

3.  Under the Settings category in the menu, select Health probes.

    ![In the Settings section, Health probes is circled.](media/b4-image46.png "Settings section")

4.  Verify if a probe exists for port 8082, and that it is "Used By" a load balancing rule. If both of these are true, you can skip the remainder of this task. Otherwise, proceed to the next step to create the probe and load-balancing rule.

    ![In the list of health probes, three health probes display. For AppPortProbe1, its Port (8082), and Used by value (AppPortLBRule1) are circled.](media/b4-image47.png "Health probes list")

5.  Select +Add on the Health probes blade.

    ![Screenshot of an Add button.](media/b4-image48.png "Add button")

6.  On the Add health probe blade, enter the following:

    -   Name: Enter **WebApiPortProbe**.

    -   Protocol: Select TCP.

    -   Port: Enter **8082**.

    -   Interval: Leave the default value.

    -   Unhealthy threshold: Leave the default value.

    -   Select OK to create the probe.

        ![Fields on the Add health probe blade are set to the previously listed settings.](media/b4-image49.png "Add health probe blade")

7.  Once the Health probe is added (this can take a few minutes to update), you will create a rule associated with this probe. Under the Settings block in the menu, select Load balancing rules.

    ![In the Settings section, Load balancing rules are circled.](media/b4-image50.png "Settings section")

8.  Select +Add on the Load balancing rules blade.

    ![Screenshot of an Add button.](media/b4-image48.png "Add button")

9.  On the Add Load balancing rules blade, enter the following:

    -   Name: Enter **LBWebApiPortRule**.

    -   IP Version: Leave IPv4 selected.

    -   Frontend IP address: Leave the default value selected.

    -   Protocol: Leave as TCP.

    -   Port: Set to **8082**.

    -   Backend port: Set to **8082**.

    -   Backend pool: Leave the default value selected.

    -   Health probe: Select the WebApiPortProbe you created previously.

    -   Leave the default values for the remaining fields, and Select OK.

    ![Fields on the Add load balancing rule blade are set to the previously defined settings.](media/b4-image51.png "Add load balancing rule blade")

10. If you get an error notification such as "Failure to create probe", ignore this, but just go check that the probe indeed exists. It should. You now have a cluster ready to deploy to and expose 8082 as the Web API endpoint / port.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
